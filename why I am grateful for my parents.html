   Today I am grateful for my parents beacause they rasied me to be the amazing young lady that I am today.
   They believed in me ,even when I didnt believe I could achive my goals ,they were there and supported me through everything and encouraged me keep trying even when I lost hope in myself,and I am also grateful that they pushed me to be the best person I could be.
   If they didn't do that for me I wouldn't have tried new things to challenge myself and set new goals that I could achive and I wouldnt be the person I am today.
   My parents were not just my parents ,they are also my best friends.They are ones that made me laugh when I was feeling down ,they comforted me when i needed it and although we have our ups and down ,its normal but nothing in this world will break my bond between my parents and I and I am forever grateful for them.
   </p>

My parents tuaght me alot of life leasons that I will carry with me for the rest of my life ,I know it might have been difficult for them to teach me these life lessons beacuse I was a very stubborn child and i did not like to listen ,i did not like being told what to do (and i apologose for that mom and dad),but what my parents taught me ,is that you should treat people the way you want to be treated.
 
 <li> Be kind to other people</li>
 <li> Always treat people with respect and kindness ,even if they dont give it back to you in return ,never resort to being nasty to other people</li>
  <li> There is so many more ,too much to write down , and i will forever be grateful that you taught me those life lessons</li>
</p>

  What I am most grateful about,is that my parents taught me to be my own person and be who i am and not try to be someone else.My mothers words to me were :"You are unique and you are your own person and there is no one else on earth like you."
  I am forever gratefulfor my mothers words ,beacuse if she did not tell me that then i would have never figured out who i was and the perosn that i am ,and what i like doing,instead i would have been out trying to be someone else and do things that someone else likes.
  After my mother told me that i started to figure out who  I really was and what i enjoyed doing,intead of liking other peoples hobbies and trying to be someone else.
  </p>
  <p> What I am also mostly grateful for is that my father taught me how to be tough and strong and how to handle things in life ( by tough and strong I dont mean that he taught me how to fight ).He taught me how to be tough beacuse i was a very quite type of person 
      and my dad knew that there were alot of cruel people in the world that would try and hurt you by even just their words,so my dad told me that I should ignore their comments and not take it personal and that soemone would only be mean to someone because they are jealous of that person.
	  He showed me that you should be strong and tough and i am grateful that I have my dad in my life for that.

   My parents taught me to be confident about who I am and not care about what people say about me ,beacuse people will always have their own judgement and opinoin on people and how someone should look and dress and have the best hair and longest hair,
   but my parents taught me that I should be happy and confindent with the way I look and with my short hair and I forever gratefull . I cant stress enough how gratefull I am for my parents.



<P> 
   My parents are the most important people in my life. They mean the absolute world to me and Ilook up to them ,beacause of the amazing people that they are.
   Without them I would have never learnt my life leasons , how to be my own person and how to be brave and strong and confindent in myself,I am forever grateful for my parents and I love them with all my heart and I just want to say thank to them for rising me to be the amazing person I am today .
   
   Hope you liked it ,I know its short but its sweet lol
   HUGS AND KISSES BYES
